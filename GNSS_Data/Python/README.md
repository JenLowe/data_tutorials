# Accessing GNSS Data in Python

The files in this folders are Python notebooks that will demonstrate some simple ways to use the GeoNet FITS API in Python. Please note these examples use Python 3, so the syntax may differ slightly to Python 2.7. We recommend you use Python 3 as it has some important bug fixes.
