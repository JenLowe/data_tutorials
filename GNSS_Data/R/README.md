File Name                     | Description  | Output
----------------------------- | -------------|---------------------------------------
[Introduction_to_GNSS_data_using_FITS_in_R](Introduction_to_GNSS_data_using_FITS_in_R.ipynb)|In this notebook we will learn how to get data from one GNSS station. By the end of this notebook you should be able to make a graph like this one | <img src="plot.png">
[Multiple_station_access_for_GNSS_data_in_R](Multiple_station_access_for_GNSS_data_in_R.ipynb)|In this notebook we will make a map of GNSS stations in an area then get the data from the station. By the end of this notebook you should know how to make a map of stations and graph the data from all these stations | <img src="map.png">
