GeoNet_FDSN_demo_R_dataselect | In this tutorial we learn how to use the language R to be able to access the data recorded by GeoNets network of weak and strong motions sensors. Then we will look at some ways we can interact with this data in the language R.
GeoNet_Seismic_Data           | In this tutorial we learn how to use the language R to be able to access GeoNetâ€™s seismic data. First we look at all events that happen above a set magnitude in one day. We then find stations near one of these events (find all stations in a set area). Finally, we will get waveform data from one of these stations.
